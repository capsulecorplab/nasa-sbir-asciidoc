This document is used for the "Identification and Significance of the Innovation" section of the Briefing chart (1100 characters and less than or equal to 15 lines)
and part 2 of the Technical Proposal

Succinctly describe:
• The proposed innovation.
• The relevance and significance of the proposed innovation to an interest, need or needs, within a
subtopic described in section 9.
• The proposed innovation relative to the state of the art.

The proposed innovations are as follows:

1. Electronic Handbooks (EHBs) are Internet-based tools that support the paperless documentation and
management of complex distributed processes (e.g., Grants/Contracts Management). Tools include user
interface, backend, requirements capture, and demonstration software.
2. Processes are represented as "Internet-based plays" where "actors" communicate thru the Internet.
For each role, EHBs guide actors thru their parts.
3. EHBs, like plays, are developed in six stages: Outline or Playwriting, Example or Rehearsal,
Implementation or Staging, Utilization or Performance, Revision or New Production, and Cross-Subprocess or Cross-Play Analysis.

The significance of the innovations is that EHBs will:

1. facilitate the movement from paper processes to paperless processes,
2. improve end users interactions within complex processes,
3. foster process, system, and product improvements, and
4. reduce costs in the overall administration of processes.

No commercial process management system offers all of these facilities and a few systems support only
a small fraction of the solution. These innovations will dramatically increase the productivity of
organizations involved in managing complex distributed processes. In order to build a process
management system which coordinates many participants and populates and locates information from
multiple repositories, it is necessary to have a common, uniform methodology for capturing the
requirements for the entire process. Otherwise the data and process becomes too fragmented, complex
and costly to develop, enhance, and maintain.
