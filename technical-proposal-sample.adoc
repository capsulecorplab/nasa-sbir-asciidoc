==== 4.1 Technical Approach ====

In order to achieve the four objectives described in Part 3 of this proposal, Coney Island, Inc., has divided
the project into four major areas:

include::proposed-deliverables.adoc[]

==== 4.2 Task Description ====

During Phase I, our effort will focus on the design of the four types of tools.

===== Task 1. Design EHBs User Interface Tools =====

EHBs User Interface Tools are software than facilitate the building of the EHBs user interface for
different EHBs applications. The key interface is the User Electronic Handbook (user EHB) for that role.
For example, <<sample-user-ehb>> shows a sample user EHB for firms that are submitting applications to the NASA
SBIR program.

Each user has an account and password and the EHB keeps track off all of the user’s information that
he/she needs to know to do his/her subprocess. For example, in the case of a user EHB for firms
submitting SBIR proposals, the EHB keeps track of all the incomplete and completed proposals that the
user is submitting. In the case of a user EHB for SBIR proposal reviewers, the EHB keeps track of all of the
incomplete and complete proposal reviews that the reviewer is assigned.

Each user EHB is architected so that the user is prompted at each stage of the subprocess. This is done
to minimize the learning effort involved in using the EHB. It also allows the user to come back after a
long period of time and easily return to complete and/or restart the subprocesses.

===== Task 2. Design EHBs Backend Tools =====

EHBs Backend Tools are software than facilitate the building of the EHBs database interfaces for
different EHBs applications. <<ehb-system-architecture>> shows a diagram for the EHBs system architecture and shows some
of the backend tools that are used to implement EHBs. The set of EHBs Backend Tools includes:

[#sample-user-ehb]

[#ehb-system-architecture]
.EHB system architecture
image::assets/EHB-system-architecture.png[EHB system architecture, 371, align="center"]

World Wide Web Servers are used to store and maintain all of the web pages used in the
implementation of EHBs. These are used by the EHBs to transfer the subparts of the EHBs between the
users and the other backend tools. Some examples of World Wide Web Servers are Netscape, Apache,
Microsoft IS Server, etc.

Database Management System Servers are used to store and maintain all of the databases used in the
implementation of EHBs. These are used to main the record type data that the user EHBs will update
and retrieve. Some examples of Database Management System Servers are Oracle, Sybase, Access,
Informix, SQL Server, etc.

Graphics Report Servers are used to display reports generated from the data in databases used in the
implementation of EHBs. These are used to generate graphic reports in the user EHBs with the data from
the Database Management System Servers. Some examples of Graphics Report Servers are IDL, Power
Point, MS Access, MS Excel, etc.

Legacy Systems are pre‐existing or independently built subsystems that can sit “underneath” the user
EHBs interfaces. Such legacy systems can be used as database and/or graphic report servers for existing
pre‐data. Some examples of Legacy Systems are accounting systems, payroll systems, etc.
Middleware Systems are used to store and maintain all of the databases used in the implementation of
EHBs. These are used to generate tabular reports in the user EHBs with the data from the Database
Management System Servers. These are also used to generate the User EHB pages themselves. Some
examples of Middleware systems are DBGenie, Cold Fusion, Java Server Pages, Active Server Pages, etc.

===== Task 3. Design EHBs Requirements Capture Tools =====

Requirements Capture Tool (RCTs) are web pages that define and document subprocesses of a
subprocess. RCTs facilitate the overall system development process: requirements capture, system
design, implementation, multi‐developer coordination, software distribution, end‐user learning, system
documentation, system revisions, and system reuse for similar processes. <<contract-admin-and-closeout-process-rct>> shows an example of
an RCT which is used to build the NASA SBIR Contract Administration and Closeout Subprocess. development-matrix-rct
shows an example of a matrix of RCTs which correspond to all of the RCTs for the entire NASA SBIR
processes.

The set of web pages in an RCT include:

Binders illustrates all of the data collected during the execution of the subprocess. For example, in the
RCT corresponding to NASA SBIR Contract Administration and Closeout Subprocess, there would be links
to contract folders and deliverables, contract award file library, deliverables library, and user profiles.

Process illustrates the “play” which defines the subprocess and tells us who produces the parts of the
binder and when they produce them. For example, in the RCT corresponding to NASA SBIR Contract
Administration and Closeout Subprocess, the subprocess would be a play with the following “acts”: 1)
Preliminaries, 2) Deliverables, 3) Advisors, 4) Modifications, 5) Closeouts and 6) Analysis. Each act would
be a subplay which defines who does what and in what order.

Example User EHBs illustrate for each role exactly what the role does in the subprocess. Implemented
User EHBs are the user interfaces in the subprocess for each role. For example, in the RCT corresponding
to NASA SBIR Contract Administration and Closeout Subprocess, some User EHBs include: Contract
Specialist, Principal Investigator/Awardee Official, Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR),
Advisor, Field Center Program Manager, etc.

Example Home Pages illustrate how the outside user or customer comes into the process and gets their
User EHB. Implemented Home Pages are used as a public interface for its customers. For example, in the
RCT corresponding to NASA SBIR Contract Administration and Closeout Subprocess, the Principal
Investigator/Awardee Official would find a link to their user EHB in which they would be able to submit
their deliverables and/or approve contract modifications.

Example Files illustrate the internal file structures for the files used to illustrate the Example user EHBs.
Implemented Files define the file structure of all of the implementation of the EHBs. In both cases, the
file structures are divided by roles. For example, in the RCT corresponding to NASA SBIR Contract
Administration and Closeout Subprocess, some User EHBs files include: Contract Specialist, Principal
Investigator/Awardee Official, Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), Advisor, Field
Center Program Manager, etc.

Suggestions provide a vehicle to collect comments and suggestions to improve the subprocess defined in
the RCT. For example, in the RCT corresponding to NASA SBIR Contract Administration and Closeout
Subprocess, the Sugggestions link could result in an e‐mail message to the system developer or an entry
into a corresponding suggestions database used by the system developer.

===== Task 4. Design EHBs Demonstration Tools =====

EHBs/RCTs Development Process, EHBs/RCTs Development Roles, and Quiz). Other items in the EHBs
Demonstration Tool are customer specific (e.g., What are EHBs?, An Example EHB, Objectives,
Requirements Capture Tools (RCTs), Multi‐Year Areas RCTs/EHBs, Multi‐Year Subprocesses RCTs/EHBs
Development Matrix, Benefits, and Documents.)

EHBs Demonstration Tools facilitate the marketing of EHBs. Each EHBs Demonstration Tool is tailored to
a particular customer so that the customer sees exactly how EHBs can be applied directly to his/her
specific processes. hsra-ehb-demo shows an example of an EHBs demonstration which was used to market
EHBs technology to the Health Services Research Administration (HRSA) of the Department of Human
Services (HHS). Some items in the EHBs Demonstration Tool are generic (e.g., Other Applications,
Architecture).

==== 4.3 Meeting the Technical Objectives ====

EHBs meets the technical objectives outlined in Part 3 as follows:

1. EHBs facilitate paperless documentation and management of complex distributed processes.
  See development-matrix-rct.
2. EHBs facilitate system development:
* Requirements Capture Tools (RCTs) reduce requirements capture costs, See <<contract-admin-and-closeout-process-rct>>.
* RCTs reduce system design costs, See <<contract-admin-and-closeout-process-rct>>. Once the examples are generated in the RCT,
  much of the design is completed.
* RCTs + Middleware (e.g., DBGenie, Cold Fusion, etc.) reduce implementation costs, See <<contract-admin-and-closeout-process-rct>>.
  Once the examples are generated, implementation follows by replacing the example with SQL
  calls to the database.
* RCTs reduce multi-developer coordination costs, See development-matrix-rct. Each developer is given their own
  RCT to design and implement.
* Web browsers reduce software distribution costs, See sample-user-ehb. EHBs are distributed via the
  World Wide Web.
* User EHBs reduce end-user learning costs, See Figure 1. EHBs are built so that the user is led to
  thru the subprocess and does not need training.
* RCTs + Middleware reduce documentation costs, See Figure 3. Each RCT represents a complete
  set of documentation for that subprocess.
* RCTs + Middleware reduce revision costs , See Figure 3. By changing the examples in the RCT
  and presenting them to the owner, the revision can be validated. When the examples are
  approved, the implementation can be correspondingly adjusted.
* RCTs + Middleware facilitate system reuse for similar processes. See <<development-matrix-rct>>. Different RCT
  subprocesses can be copied and reused for similar subprocesses.
3. EHBs and RCTs facilitate integration of independently developed subsystems, See <<development-matrix-rct>>. The matrix
of subprocess lets one look at all existing subprocesses. This will lead to integration of user interfaces
followed by integration of backends.
4. EHBs facilitate process and system improvement by providing "multiple points of view", e.g.,
* Multiple User Perspectives. By looking at a subprocess thru different user roles (e.g., different
  user EHBs), one captures more requirements.
* Multiple Subprocesses. By comparing similar subprocesses (e.g., SBIR Phase I and II proposal
  submissions), one can’t help but discover efficiencies.
* Multiple Subprocess Data. By examining an entire process thru the eyes of a single role or user
  type (e.g., the SBIR firm through the entire SBIR process), one creates simplification with regard
  to the user.
* Multiple Applications. By examining similar applications over the same organization (e.g., grants
  over different programs in the same agency), one can’t help but see commonalities.
* Multiple Organizations. By examining grants over multiple Federal Agencies, one can’t help but
  see commonalities.

////

Coney Island, Inc.'s final report will demonstrate to NASA our total commitment to the development and
marketing of a complex distributed process management system product. Coney Island, Inc, perceives
the Phase I work to be a complete definition of the design of the product and a demonstration of a
prototype of the major innovations identified in Part 2 of this proposal. Coney Island, Inc., envisions
Phase II work to encompass the building of a full commercial product with associated production quality
technical and user documentation.

This effort is to form the basis of the paperless complex distributed process management product Coney
Island, Inc. brings to market. At the start of Phase III, Coney Island, Inc., plans to either finance its initial
operation with venture capital, or if no venture capital is obtained, the principals are committed to self‐
finance the venture during Phase III. The NASA SBIR programs itself will serve as the initial beta site for
Coney Island, Inc.'s process management system.

Coney Island, Inc. is located in Southern Brooklyn and currently leases an office space in a 4 story
(earthquake safe) office building. All Coney Island, Inc., employees have at least one personal computer
(most have IBM PCs, 1800mhz, while others have Macintoshes or both in their office).

Coney Island, Inc. was incorporated in the state of New York on 12 January 1993. Coney Island, Inc. Is a
company organized to exploit the computerized documentation market. Coney Island, Inc., was founded
by Mr. Nathan Frankfurter (the proposed Principal Investigator) and Mr. Pierre Fries (Executive Vice
President). Coney Island, Inc., is located in West Los Angeles and currently leases an office space in a 4
story (earthquake safe) office building. All Coney Island, Inc., employees have at least one personal
computer (most have IBM PCs, while others have Macintoshes or both in their office).

On these two premises, Mr. Frankfurter and Mr. Fries began designing a paperless complex distributed
process management system in the second quarter of 1996. Mr. Frankfurter selected Mr. Fries because
his former company, Hot Dog Systems, Inc. (HDS), had successfully employed Mr. Fries numerous time
as a Senior Software Designer for a number of software development projects. Of the over 100 different
consultants HDS used during the two plus decades Mr. Frankfurter was President, Mr. Fries was by far
the most productive/creative designer and programmer his former company employed. Since Coney
Island, Inc., is a relatively new company, the past performance listed below are for a few of the projects
Mr. Frankfurter (while President of PSS) and Mr. Fries (while Senior Scientist at Grill Corporation and an
independent consultant) were instrumental members of during the last few years:
